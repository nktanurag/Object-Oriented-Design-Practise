Assumption:
At the start of the game every player will be at position 0.
Turns will be made in the order of creation of Players.
Two of the following can not be at same current position.
    snake_head,snake_tail,ladder_head,ladder_tail
No possibility of game getting in an infinite loop.
For example:Suppose there is a mouth of snake from 94 to 99 at each position so the 
participant can not move to 100 by any move.
The player which will reach the 100 first will be winner and the game will be closed.
